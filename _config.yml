description: "In 1918 the world was hit by a virulent strain of influenza. Becoming a global pandemic, it affected approximately 500 million individuals worldwide. The disease spread and eventually came to the University of Idaho, primarily infecting members of the newly established Student Army Training Corps. In response to the pandemic the university worked to stop the spread of the disease by cancelling activities, enacting a quarantine, using gauze face masks, and other measures. This exhibit includes correspondence, reports, and news articles from the time of the 1918 influenza outbreak to highlight this significant time, not only in world history, but also local history."
